# Unifsearch
Unified search page for every search engine.

The goal of this project is to remove the hassle of choosing the search engine of a browser everytime you want to browse on a different one. In this page, you can choose whatever search engine you want to browse on and hit search. No strings attached.


Unifsearch has been integrated into my website: https://bedantadey17.github.io/search
